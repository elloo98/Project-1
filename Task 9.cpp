/*Reflections
1	I knew most of this, I took a cource in C++ in highschool a  couple of years ago, the problem is remembering what I had learned.
	Something I know I don't recall from previous cources is some of the less used modifiers for printf and scanf.

2	The most difficult part was overcoming the quite esoteric way you are supposed to handle scanf and integers, to figure out the math behind task 6,
	and to correctly handle the datatype in task 8, I tried to use an int instead of a char to make numerical pyramids possible to 64 but printf
	didn't like an int as an input and it was late in the night so I sort of rushed out a solution by switching to char.

3	Task 7 seems a bit out of place, the previousand following tasks are quite hard on comparisonand I solved it in maybe ten minutes,
	seven of which were typing out code, two were testingand one thinking.

How many hours ? 6.5
